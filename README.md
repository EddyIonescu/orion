# orion
Finds (or rather, hunts for) transit data (agencies, routes (GeoJSON), realtime vehicle locations) and sends it to Cassandra


## Etymology

Many TTC buses are of the Orion VII Model while Orion was also a giant huntsman that could walk on water (being Poseidon's son). Orion and Cassandra are both Greek mythological figures.
